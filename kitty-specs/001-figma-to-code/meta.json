  "source_description": "Build a web-based Figma-to-Code Mapping Rule Builder.\n\nThis is a developer workbench for creating and testing transformation rules that map Figma design properties to code. The rules created here will be exported as JSON and used in a separate export tool later.\n\nUser provides a Figma file URL and node ID. The tool fetches the node tree with geometry data, design tokens/variables, and a reference screenshot via Figma API. All data is saved locally - no repeated API calls.\n\nThe Figma JSON is transformed into an intermediate structure called AltNode that normalizes Figma properties into CSS-familiar equivalents. For example, layoutMode HORIZONTAL becomes display flex with direction row, itemSpacing becomes gap, fills become background colors, etc. This AltNode structure is computed on-the-fly from the saved Figma JSON.\n\nThe interface has three main areas. Left panel shows the AltNode tree for navigation. Center panel is a code editor where users create mapping rules in JSON format. Each rule has a selector that matches AltNode properties and a transformer that defines the output structure - HTML tag, CSS classes, inline styles, etc. Rules have priorities for handling conflicts.\n\nRight panel shows live previews in three tabs: React JSX, React with Tailwind, and pure HTML/CSS. Each tab displays both the rendered result in an iframe and the generated code. When users edit rules in the center panel, all three previews update instantly.\n\nThe tool saves two things locally: the raw Figma data files and the mapping rules JSON. The rules JSON is what gets exported for use in the production export tool.\n\nPersonal access token for Figma API goes in a config file, not user-facing auth.",
